Accountability means the state of being responsible or answerable for a system, its behavior, and its potential impacts. Accountability is an acknowledgement of responsibility for actions, decisions, and products.

Responsibility can be legal or moral (ethical). **Legally**, an actor is responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that actor for that event. **Morally**, an actor is responsible for an act, if they can be blamed for the action. Moral and legal responsibility are different things. They do not always coincide; an agent can be legally responsible even if they were not morally responsible, and vice versa.  In this course, we´ll focus only on moral aspects of responsibility.

In AI ethics, there are three different senses or dimensions of accountability. They point to a different means of action including:

* The question of determining the responsibility – which individuals (or groups) are accountable for the impact of algorithms or AI? Who is responsible for what effect within the overall socio-technical system?
* A feature of the societal  system that develops, produces,  and uses AI
* A feature of the AI system itself

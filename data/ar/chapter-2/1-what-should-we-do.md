### The principle of beneficence

 *“AI inevitably becomes entangled in the ethical and political dimensions of vocations and practices in which
it is embedded. AI Ethics is effectively a microcosm of the political and ethical challenges faced in society.”*

 *-Brent Mittelstadt*

The principle of **beneficence** says “do good”, while the principle of **non-maleficence** states “do no harm”. Although these two principles may look similar, they represent distinct principles. Beneficence encourages the creation of beneficial AI (“AI should be developed for the common good and the benefit of humanity”), while non-maleficence concerns the negative consequences and risks of AI.

Generally, AI ethics have been primarily concerned with the principle of non-maleficence. Discussion has focused mostly on questions of how developers, manufacturers, authorities, or other stakeholders should minimize the ethical risks – discrimination, privacy protection, physical and social harms –  that can arise from AI applications. Often, these discussions are stated in terms of  intentional misuse, malicious hacking, technical measures, or risk-management strategies.

Critics claim that the emphasis on non-maleficence makes ethics a matter of finding technical solutions for technical problems. Moral problems are seen as things that can be solved by technical “fixes”, or by good design alone. The wider ethical and societal context in which technical systems are embedded is forgotten.  Many significant issues that direct the control, governance and societal dimensions of AI are ignored.

Technology researcher Evgeny Morozov calls this “tech solutionism” – the conviction that problems caused by technology can always be fixed by more technology.

As a result, deep and difficult ethical problems are oversimplified and unanswered. One of the questions is the problem of the “common good”. What, exactly, does that mean? In this chapter, we’ll take a look at one classical philosophical answer.

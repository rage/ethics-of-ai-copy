Values and norms are the basic elements of ethics. The concept “value” means, roughly, the degree of
importance of a thing or an action. Values provide ideals and standards with which to evaluate things, choices,
actions, and events. In ethics, the focus is primarily on moral values, although other types of values
– economic, aesthetic, epistemic (or knowledge-related) – are sometimes relevant morally. For example,
economic factors may play morally significant role, if economic decisions have morally significant
consequences to people.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic values

Values can be divided into **extrinsic** (also called “instrumental”) and **intrinsic** values. For example, money
has extrinsic or instrumental value. Money is valuable only because one can use it for other things, such as
to provide better medical care for the people. These things, in turn, may be good for what they lead to: for
example, for better health. And those things, in turn, may be good only for what they lead to – for example
the better quality of life. Intrinsically valuable things are typically “big moral values” – happiness, freedom,
wellbeing. These are things that are good as they are. For some, they also explain the “goodness to be
found in all the other things” (cf. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1094a).

### Norms

Norms are value-based principles, commands and imperatives – such as the sets of AI guidelines. They tell
what one should do, or what is expected of someone. Norms may be prescriptive (encouraging positive
behavior; for example, “be fair”) or proscriptive (discouraging negative behavior; for example, “do not
discriminate”).

There are several types of norms:

* Some norms are merely statistical regularities: one notices that many computer scientists tend to
wear black T-shirts.

* Some norms are social norms; they tell what people in a group believe to be appropriate action in
that group.

* Moral norms are prescriptive or proscriptive rules with obligatory force beyond that of social or
statistical expectations. For example, “Do not use AI for behaviour manipulation” is a moral norm.

* Norms may also be legal norms. Importantly, a legal norm may not be a moral norm, and vice
versa. Simply, the fact that “X is a law” does not make it a moral principle. Instead, one can always
ask: “Is this law morally acceptable or not?”

Normative claims do not describe how the world is. Instead, **they prescribe how the world should be**. This
is, they imply “ought-to” evaluations, in distinction to sentences that provide "is" types of assertions. For
instance, a sentence "This machine-learning system is a black-box system" is descriptive, while a sentence
“Machine-learning systems should be transparent" is normative.

Importantly, facts do not dictate our norms. As Scottish philosopher, David Hume (1711–76) states it, one
should not make normative claims about what should be, based only on descriptive statements about what
is. This does not mean that facts do not take any part in our moral consideration, but that you cannot get
from an “is” to an “ought” without the use of some purely normative value statement along the way.

This principle is known as “Hume´s guillotine”. It states that moral norms or claims cannot be justified only
by appealing to facts. As Hume remarks, one cannot derive the “ought from is”. For example, the fact that
there is a biased data set does not alone imply that the data should (or shouldn’t) be biased. Instead, moral
attitudes depend on other ethical considerations and preferences, not just mere facts. Why are we
concerned with the issue of biased data? Well, the problem clearly is not the fact that there are biased
data. The real problem is that biases may enhance discrimination.

Importantly, Hume´s guillotine does not claim that facts don’t matter. They do. The point is that facts
(alone) don´t solve ethical problems. Instead, ethical problems require genuinely ethical discussion, too.

So far we have looked at core ethical principles around which AI ethics conversations currently revolve. In this section, we will step away from the contents of ethical statements to take a wider perspective into the whole project of AI ethics. This means looking at the /making/ and /doing/ of AI ethics as a cultural phenomenon, a project with diverse members with differing stakes, and producing texts that can be analysed as cultural products. That is, AI Ethics is created by certain people, at a certain time, for certain purposes.

## Ethics Guidelines as texts that do

The subject of ethical considerations pertaining to technology is not a new question; Rather, it has been asked in a very similar form throughout many different iterations of technological development. In the academic sphere, the interplay of technology, ethics and values have been considered in fields like philosophy, sociology, science and technology studies (STS) and design studies, all with their own angle on the issues. As illustration the historical continuities around these issues, the sociologist Langdon Winner wrote in his 1990 essay “Engineering Ethics and Political Imagination”, that a difficulty lies in ethical discourse centring on highly hypothetical and limited “troubling incidents”, without calling into question the larger responsibilities of the whole engineering industry. These are similar troubles which are facing the AI ethics project, now 30 years later.

While the troubles may not be new, the contemporary AI ethics project has much more public interest and wider stakeholder participation than engineering ethics has had before. Many more are learning about it, many are hoping to implement AI ethics somehow in their work, and many companies, communities, states and individuals have stakes in the outcomes. With this new wave of interest, the AI ethical principle guideline has become the archetypical way of doing ethics.

In the next section, we will look at some critical perspectives into AI ethics guidelines as a way of doing ethics. Before we get into, let’s look a concept from the social science which will help us understand ethics guidelines as texts. That is the concept of performativity.

<text-box variant="hint" name="Performativity">

First coined by philosopher John L. Austin, but made more famous by feminist scholar Judith Butler, performativity is a capacity of words to /do/ things in the world. That is, sometimes making statements does not just describe the world, but also performs a social function beyond describing. As an example (from Austin), when a priest declares a couple to be “husband and wife”,  they are not describing the state of their relationship. Rather by that very declaration, the institution of marriage is brought about. The words /preform/ the marrying of the two people. In a similar way, also other acts of communication can have a performative quality, not just presenting information, but effecting change in the world.

Now to AI ethics guidelines. What function do they preform? AlgorithmWatch divides the guidelines they have archived into three groups: Binding Agreements, Voluntary Commitments and Recommendations. These reflect not only differing levels of commitment, but also organisational capacities to enact and reinforce ethical action within the organisation. While publishing ethics guidelines signals an interest in evaluating the effects of technologies from an ethical perspective, the capacity for guidelines to incite reflection and action has been widely called into question.

German sociologist Ulrick Beck has commented about engineering ethics, that:

“[ethics] plays the role of a bicycle brake on an intercontinental airplane” (Beck 1988, 194).

As evidence of this, researchers have found that ethical guidelines have little to no effect on the behaviour of tech professionals. Results like this raise two questions: how can ethical considerations be put to practice, and what is the performative function of ethical guidelines, if not to be constraints on technological development?

### Guidelines as a call for Deregulation:

Ben Wagner, Ethics as an Escape from Regulation: From ethics-washing to ethics shopping? in MIREILLE HILDEBRANDT (ED.), BEING PROFILING. COGITAS ERGO SUM (2018).

Some authors have argued that ethical language deployed by companies is a communicative strategy that provides support for self-regulation. The implicit narrative in publishing ethics guidelines is that of a strong moral reflection at the core of business practices, which makes industry regulation unnecessary. Why should our business be restricted, since we are already so ethical? While this communicative strategy is more strongly motivated for private companies, also national ethics guidelines reflect a tension between ethical consideration, regulation and market driven innovation. These conceptualise ethics as a value, to be put into healthy balance with competing values such as economic growth.

### Guidelines as Assurances

/Kerr, Aphra, Marguerite Barry, and John D Kelleher. “Expectations of Artificial Intelligence and the Performativity of Ethics: Implications for Communication Governance.” Big Data & Society 7, no. 1 (January 1, 2020): 2053951720915939. https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720915939./

Others have argued that ethics guidelines work as assurance to investors and the public. That is, in the age of social media, news of businesses' moral misgivings spread fast and can cause quick shifts in the public image of a company. Publishing ethics guidelines makes assurances that the organisation has the competence for producing ethical language, and the capacity to take part in public moral discourse to assuage public concern.

### Guidelines as Expertise

Greene, Daniel, Anna Lauren Hoffmann, and Luke Stark. “Better, Nicer, Clearer, Fairer: A Critical Assessment of the Movement for Ethical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,” n.d., 10.

With the AI boom well on its way, the need for new kinds of expertise arises, and competition around ownership of the AI issue increases. Expertise is only effective if it is publicly recognised, and in the race to become a leading AI organisation, publications are a way to secure visibility. According to Greene et al. “ethics and ethical codes designate and defend social status and expertise”. That is, taking part in the AI ethics discussion by publishing as a set of ethical guidelines is an easy way to perform expertise, and increase the organisations chances to be invited to a seat at the table in regards to AI issues.

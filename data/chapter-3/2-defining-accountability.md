## **1. Defining accountability**
Responsibility can be legal or ethical. Legally, an actor is responsible for an event when a legal
system is liable to penalise that actor for that event. Morally, an actor is responsible for an act, if
(s)he can be blamed for the action. Moral and legal responsibility are different things. They do not
always coincide; an agent can be legally responsible even if she was not morally responsible, and
vice versa. In this course, we´ll focus only on moral aspects of responsibility.

In AI ethics, there are three different senses or dimensions of accountability. They point to a
different locus of action:

* the question of determing the responsibility: which individuals (or groups) are accountable
for the impact of algorithms or AI? Who is responsible for what effect within the overall
socio-technical system?

* a feature of the societal system that develops, produces, and uses AI.

* a feature of the AI system itself.

## **What is “accountability”?**

 “Accountability” is about an acknowledgement of responsibility for actions, decisions
and products. In the field of AI ethics, there exist three main areas of accountability,:

Accountability as a feature of the AI system itself.
Accountability as the question of determining responsibility. Which individuals (or groups) are accountable for the impact of algorithms or AI? Who is responsible for what effect within the overall socio-technical system?
Accountability as a feature of the societal system that develops, produces, and uses AI.

Accountability presupposes a “power-relation”. It determines who is in control and who is to be blamed. Responsibility may be a legal or an ethical question.

**Legally**, an actor is responsible for an event when a legal system is liable to penalise that actor for that event.

**Morally**, an actor is responsible for an act if they can be blamed for that action.

Legal and moral responsibility are two different things. They do not always coincide; an agent can be legally responsible even if they were not morally responsible, and vice versa. We’ll discuss more about what moral responsibility means in practice in section II.

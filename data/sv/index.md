Ethics of AI is an open course teaching the basics of ethical issues relevant for AI. It aims to be an introduction to the thematic for a wide audience. The aim is that the course is useful not only for people developing AI systems but also for the public. There is a lot of on-going discussion about AI in different forums. One of our goals is that the course would allow people to understand better the different aspects of the discussion and be more educated in forming their own opinions about the issues. We also hope that the course is useful for people considering the use of AI in society, in particular domains, or in particular tasks. The aim is that after the course decision makers would have better ability to recognize what ethically issues the introduction of AI could bring. Likewise it should provide tools for thinking how to avoid these ethical problems or how to balance the different points of view between different objectives and risks.

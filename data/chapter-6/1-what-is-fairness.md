For this thought experiment, let’s assume that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all matricular examinations in Finnish upper secondary schools were cancelled. Instead of an exam, an alternative method had to be designed and implemented to determine the qualification grades to be given to students for that year. Students are accepted to university on the basis of their grades, so the grades of matricular examinations are extremely important.

The government decided that teachers would give an estimate of how they thought their students would have performed on the exams, and that will determine their grades. Teachers were asked to make evaluations of their pupils.

To combat grade inflation, an algorithm that weighted the scores based on the historic performance of individual secondary schools was used. The idea was that the algorithm would compensate for the tendency of teachers to inflate the expected performance of their students, and thus the estimations would more accurately predict how test-takers would have actually performed. The  algorithm was designed with two pieces of information: the ranking of students within a school and their school’s historical performance.

As a result, on a national level grades corresponded with the grade distribution in previous years pretty well. However, the algorithm downgraded nearly 40 per cent of the grades predicted by teachers. Data showed that the results of those from lower socio-economic backgrounds were downgraded more often than the ones with higher socio-economic backgrounds. For low-income students who were hoping to go to university, the results were devastating.

Many would take this thought experiment as an example of algorithmic unfairness. It does not only describe how algorithms themselves can result in unfair results, but also how algorithms can reinforce already existing economic and societal bias.

## Fairness and bias

Fairness and bias are probably the most discussed ethical issues related to the contemporary algorithms. Why are they so central?

* **Firstly**, fairness is a fundamental element of social stability. As the philosopher John Rawls remarks, the stability of a society – or any group – depends upon the extent to which the members of that society feel that they are being treated in a just manner. When some of society's members feel that they are treated in an unfair manner, it usually creates a foundation for social unrest, disturbances, and strife. People hold social unity only to the extent that their institutions are fair.

* **Secondly**, as Immanuel Kant remarked, human beings have the same dignity. In virtue of this dignity they are entitled to be treated as equals. If individuals are treated unfairly – especially on arbitrary grounds – their fundamental human dignity is violated. When this violation is implemented in practices, it leads to discrimination.

However, as the example of grade inflation algorithm illustrates, fairness is a complex issue. The algorithm was designed to correct grade inflation because it was thought to be unfair if students got an unfair advantage on their grades. As a result, paradoxically, the algorithm ended up reinforcing already existing societal bias.

In this chapter, we’ll focus on fairness, biases and discrimination. We’ll address questions such as: What, exactly, is fairness? Should fairness consist of ensuring everyone has an equal probability of obtaining some benefit? Or should fairness take the individual differences into account, and recognize the diversity? And finally, are fairness and discrimination synonymous, or do they mean separate things?

<p style="color:red;">Here, we will take a closer look at ethics in general before exploring the meaning of AI ethics.</p>

<br>

Before looking at AI ethics, we need to set out what ethics means in the first place.

Ethics seeks to answer questions like “what is good or bad?”, “what is right or what is wrong”, or “what is
justice, well-being or equality”. As a discipline, ethics involves systematizing, defending, and recommending
concepts of right and wrong conduct by using [conceptual analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_analysis), [thought experiments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thought-experiment/), and [argumentation](https://iep.utm.edu/argument/). (If you want to know more about philosophical reasoning, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKEhdsnKKHs) by Crash Course
Philosophy.)

**1) Meta-ethics** studies the meaning of ethical concepts, the existence of ethical entities (ontology) and the possibility of ethical knowledge (epistemology).

**2) Normative ethics** concerns the practical means of determining a moral (or ethically correct) course of action.

**3) Applied ethics** concerns what a moral agent (defined as someone who can judge what is right and wrong and be held accountable) is obligated or permitted to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.

AI ethics is a subfield of applied ethics. Nowadays, AI ethics is considered part of the ethics of technology specific to robots and other artificially intelligent entities. It concerns the questions of how developers, manufacturers, authorities and operators should behave in order to minimize the ethical risks that can arise from AI in society, either from design, inappropriate application, or intentional misuse of the technology.

These concerns can be divided into three time frames as follows:

* immediate, here-and-now questions about, for instance, security, privacy or transparency in AI
systems
* medium-term concerns about, for instance, the impact of AI on the military use, medical care, or
justice and educational systems
* longer-term concerns about the fundamental ethical goals of developing and implementing AI in
society

For a long time, AI ethics was taken to mean mostly machine and roboethics. These cover the study of the ethical codes of artificial moral agents. As research fields, they are based on a scenario where machines can one day be responsible for ethically relevant choices, and can even be possibly considered as ethical agents or autonomous moral agents. As a comparison, animals are generally not considered moral agents. We don’t judge a squirrel’s behaviour as right or wrong, and we don’t assume they have the capacity to know the difference.

Machine and roboethics span from the development of ethically responsive autonomous vehicles to the design of ethical codes for moral autonomous agents.

Isaac Asimov (1942) famously proposed “three laws of robotics” that would guide the moral action of machines:

- A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

- A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict
with the First Law.

- A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or
Second Laws.

These days, AI ethics is a more general field, and closer to engineering ethics: we don’t have to assume the machine is an ethical agent to analyze its ethics. Research in the field of AI ethics ranges from reflections on how ethical or moral principles can be implemented in autonomous machines to the empirical analysis on how trolley problems are solved, the systematic analysis of ethical principles such as fairness, and the critical evaluation of ethical frameworks.
